SMART CONTRACTS

There is a simple smart contract
A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

SUBCURRENCY 
 we have to put some contracts that forms a simplest form of cryptocurrency.

ETHEREUM VIRUTUAL MACHINE 
 
EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in ethereum.
the code running in the EVM has no access to network ,filesystem or other processes.
There are two kinds of accounts in ethereum which shares the same address space 
they are:
1.External accounts
2.contract accounts
EXTERNAL ACCOUNT 
 This are controlled by public private key pairs
CONTRACT ACCOUNTS
 this are controlled by the code stored together with account
Every account has a persistent key-value store mapping 256-bit words to 256-bit words called storage.
TRANSACTIONS
A transaction is a message that is sent from one account to another account.
